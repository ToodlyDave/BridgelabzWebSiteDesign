                <p>Alright let's be honest... The only reason this game became so popular was cus of covid. Where people were stuck at home and were looking for a way to stay connected to each other. The game had released a couple of years earlier and had had no impact. Although its not too popular anymore, the makers must be loaded by now lol.</p>
